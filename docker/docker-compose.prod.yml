# This script configures a multi-container setup to serve MPCAutofill and all
# its dependencies. Simply navigate to the base directory and run
# "docker-compose up" to get started. Optionally, you can pass "-d" to detach
# all containers and their outputs to the background. By default, MPCAutofill
# is served at http://localhost:8000. You can adjust the port near the bottom
# of this file. Many code templates and inspirations are taken from blog post:
