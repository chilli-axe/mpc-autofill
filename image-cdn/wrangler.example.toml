# You need to modify this file by setting the following four fields.
# The setup process for creating your Google API fields is described in the wiki:
# 1. account_id - this is the UUID of your Cloudflare account.
# 2. GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID - looks like `1234567890.apps.googleusercontent.com`
# 3. GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
# 4. GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN - prefixed with 1/
# 5. WORKER_DOMAIN - will likely end in `workers.dev` unless you've put a custom domain in front of this Worker.
