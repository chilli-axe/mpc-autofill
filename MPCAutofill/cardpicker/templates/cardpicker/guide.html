        <a href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/" target="_blank">MakePlayingCards.com</a> (MPC) is a
        Hong Kong-headquartered company that <em>"offers an online platform to create high quality, customised playing
        cards... at wholesale prices."</em> Ordering cards through MPC uses an intuitive drag and drop GUI where the
        user uploads print-ready images for each card.
    </p>
    <p>
        MPC is fantastic for cheaply printing playtest (proxy) cards for casual trading card game play. Cards printed
        with MPC are not counterfeits, as they're intentionally impossible to mistake for real cards &#8212 they don't 
        have holo stamps, typically are labelled as not for sale and have different set symbols, and have different 
        cardbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some folks in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mpcproxies/" target="_blank">r/mpcproxies</a> community
        share Google Drives with print-ready Magic: The Gathering card images they've prepared, making it possible 
        to print a huge variety of cards with no image editing skills.

    <h3>Why MPC Autofill</h3>
    <p>
    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3 float-md-right mpc-vid">
        <video loop autoplay muted playsinline class="embed-responsive-item">

        </video>
    </div>
    Normally, ordering through MPC is very laborious. You have to collect the card images for everything in your order
    yourself, then manually upload each card, and drag and drop them into the correct slots.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Double-faced cards are also a headache. If you want to order 396 cards and 2 of them have two faces,
        you have to manually drag and drop your cardback to the other 394 cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>We make it dead easy to order with MPC.</b> Just paste your desired card list in MPC Autofill, and
        we'll search a wide range of community Drives for you. Then, you can customise your order by choosing between
        different versions of cards and different cardbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you're happy, a button press exports an XML file describing your order. Then, a small program will read
        this file, download every card from Google Drive for you, and automatically fill them into MPC.
    </p>

    <h4>1. Customise Your Order</h4>
    <p>
    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 float-md-right mpc-vid">
        <video loop autoplay muted playsinline class="embed-responsive-item">

    </div>

    Type the list of cards you'd like to print with MPC into the home page, including how many of each you'd like.
    Then click <b>Submit</b> to be taken to the review page. Or, can upload a CSV of your card list, which
    lets you specify what cards should be on the fronts and backs &#8212 this lets you easily print one deck on the
    fronts and one deck on the backs. Download the CSV template
    <b><a href="{% static 'cardpicker/template.csv' %}">here</a></b>.
    You can also re-upload an existing XML order to edit it further.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you'd like to only use some community Drives, you can click <b>Select Drives</b> before submitting your
        card list. Here, you can selectively enable or disable each Drive, and you can drag & drop to change which
        Drives' cards are shown before others.
    </p>
    <p>
        The review page shows how your order will be filled into MPC. If a card has multiple versions, use the
        left and right arrows to page through them. You can synchronise the selected versions of cards as well, by
        clicking the <b>padlock</b> above the card &#8212 e.g. if you'd like the 10th version of 20 copies of a card.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you misspell a card name or change your mind, you can click on the card's name and input a new search query,
        which will just change that one card. You can also insert more cards into your order by clicking the <b>Add
        Cards</b>
        button in the top right.
    </p>
    <p>
        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 float-md-right mpc-vid">
            <video loop autoplay muted playsinline class="embed-responsive-item">

            </video>
        </div>
        Click the <b>arrow</b> above a card to download the currently selected full-resolution image. You can also 
        download all images in your order by clicking the <b>Download All Images</b> button &#8212 please note that 
        you should have popups enabled for this to work properly.
    </p>
    </p>
        On this page, you can also choose your cardstock and cardback. S30 and S33 cardstock options are the closest 
        to the feel of real cards, with some people preferring S33 (though it's slightly more expensive). Linen and 
        P10 Plastic are options to consider if you like to play with unsleeved cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you're satisfied with your order, click the <b>Generate Order</b> button. This will download a file
        called <code>cards.xml</code> to your computer, which we'll need in the next step.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Download and Run the Tool</h4>
    <p>
        At this point, you're ready to automatically fill your order into MPC! First, download the tool from
        <a href="https://github.com/ndepaola/mpc-autofill/releases" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You only need to
        download <code>autofill.exe</code>, not the rest of the source code. Or download <code>autofill</code>
        (no extension) if you're on macOS &#8212 see the GitHub release and guide video for macOS-specific 
        instructions. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed on your computer as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        I recommend creating an account with MakePlayingCards now, as it'll come in handy in a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Put your <code>cards.xml</code> file into the same folder as <code>autofill.exe</code> and run it.
        If you're unsure about running an executable on your computer for security reasons, you can download the
        Python source code on <a href="https://github.com/ndepaola/mpc-autofill/blob/master/autofill.py"
                                 target="_blank">GitHub</a> and run that instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you run MPC Autofill, it'll do two things:
    <ul>
        <li>Create a folder where <code>autofill.exe</code> is stored, called <code>cards</code>, and start downloading
            all images required for your order to this folder,
        </li>
        <li>Open an automated Chrome window and navigate to MPC's website. Your order details are specified for you
            (cardstock and number of cards in order), then your cards are automatically uploaded and dragged to the
            correct slots. This can take a while, so feel free to do something else in the meantime.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Also &#8212 it's completely normal for cards to upload and fill into MPC out of order, nothing to worry about.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once it's finished, your Chrome window will take you to the MPC finalise order page. Here, you can log in with
        your MPC account and save it to your Saved Projects, or you can complete the order and enter it into MPC's
        production system right away.
    </p>
    <p>
        And that's it! I hope you found this guide easy to understand and follow. If you have any questions, shoot me a
        message on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chilli_Axe/">Reddit</a>! I'd love to make this website and tool
        as easy to use as possible.
