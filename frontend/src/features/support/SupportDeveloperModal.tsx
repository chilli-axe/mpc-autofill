        <h4>A bit about me</h4>
        <p>
          Hey there! Thanks for checking out {ProjectName}. I&apos;m Nick /
          chilli_axe, the creator and primary developer of this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m responsible for the software development of this project
          &mdash; this website, the code that image repository servers run on,
          and the desktop tool that automates{" "}
          <a href={MakePlayingCardsURL} target="_blank">
            {MakePlayingCards}
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          I started developing {ProjectName} in early 2020 while I was in uni to
          simplify how the tabletop gaming community shares its MPC print-ready
          images &mdash; at the time, we were manually browsing through Google
          Drives to find cards we wanted to print and dragging & dropping them
          into MPC.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, I&apos;m working full-time and continuing to develop{" "}
          {ProjectName} by night, and I&apos;m passionate about delivering the
          best print tooling I can to the tabletop gaming community.
        </p>
        <p>
          {ProjectName} is completely open source software (licensed under
          GPL-3) and all of its features will always be free.
        </p>
        <p>
