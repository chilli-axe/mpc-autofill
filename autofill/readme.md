# MPC Autofill Desktop Client

## Overview

This tool ingests XML files generated with this project's web component, and:

- Downloads the images in your order from Google Drive (into the directory `/cards` from the executable's location),
- Uses Selenium (browser automation) for Chromium browsers to automatically populate your order with [MakePlayingCards.com](https://makeplayingcards.com).

Once the autofilling process completes, you can either complete and pay for your order or save it to your MakePlayingCards account to purchase/modify later.

**Note**: Automated Chromium browsers do not support signing in with Google accounts for security reasons; you will need to create an account with MakePlayingCards directly and sign in with it.

## User Guide

### Windows

- Download the latest Windows release from [the Releases tab](https://github.com/chilli-axe/mpc-autofill/releases),
- Move the executable file into the same directory as your XML order,
- Double-click the executable to run. If you have multiple XML files in the directory, you will be prompted to select one. **Do not** run it by dragging your XML file onto it.
- If text doesn't seem to render properly (bold text and progress bars don't work), try right-clicking on the window, opening Properties, and setting the font to `Cascadia Mono`. You may also want to configure `cmd.exe` to default to this font.

### macOS and Linux

- Download the latest macOS or Linux release from [the Releases tab](https://github.com/chilli-axe/mpc-autofill/releases),
- Your computer will probably not recognise the file as an executable, preventing you from double-clicking it on macOS and from running it in the Terminal in Linux. [This guide by Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/terminal/apdd100908f-06b3-4e63-8a87-32e71241bab4/mac) has further information on the topic. Fixing it is easy:
  - On **macOS**:
    - Put `autofill-macos` and your XML file on your desktop
    - Open the Terminal (this is located in `Applications/Utilities`),
    - Type the following commands into the terminal window, one at a time (you can copy and paste them from here):
      - `cd ~/Desktop`
      - `chmod +x autofill-macos`
    - Run the tool by double-clicking it. **Do not** run it by dragging your XML file onto it.
  - On **Linux**:
    - Put `autofill-linux` and your XML file on your desktop
    - Open the Terminal,
    - Type the following commands into the terminal window, one at a time (you can copy and paste them from here):
      - `cd ~/Desktop`
      - `chmod +x autofill-linux`
      - `./autofill-linux`
- You may have issues with running the executable on older versions of macOS [due to a limitation of PyInstaller](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49908236/pyinstaller-executable-fails-on-old-os-x). GitHub is configured to compile the tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux (Ubuntu) on the latest available version of each operating system.

### Editing Existing Projects

By default, the tool will create the order as a new MPC project. The tool also supports continuing with saved MPC projects - run the program with the command line argument `--skipsetup` to use this functionality. You will be prompted to log into MPC, navigate to a saved project, and continue editing it before the program will continue.

Some notes on how editing an existing project with `--skipsetup` works:

- The project's bracket and quantity will be automatically adjusted according to the XML being processed,
- Any slots which have already been filled will not be refilled,
- If an image is now allocated to more slots, the tool will fill the unfilled slots with the image from the first filled slot for that image.

### Specifying a Browser

By default, the tool will configure a driver for Google Chrome. The three major Chromium-based browsers are supported (Chrome, Edge, and Brave), and you can specify which browser should be used to configure the driver with the `--browser` command line argument.

### Exporting to PDF

You can optionally export the downloaded images to a PDF which can be uploaded to a card printing site by using the `--exportpdfs` command line argument. Once the images are downloaded, press enter and you'll be presented with a few questions. If you plan to upload the PDFs to MakePlayingCards, select `yes` when asked about storing the separate faces in their own PDF. If you plan to use DriveThruCards, select `no` for that question, and then set the number of cards to include per exported file. If using DriveThruCards, be aware that they have a file size upload limit of 1gb, so depending on the file size of the selected images, your order may need to be set to a lower number, like 30 or 40 cards.

### Process multiple XML files in batch

You can optionally process multiple XML files generated on https://mpcfill.com in a single script execution. This can be useful if you want to prepare multiple decks, individually wrapped, with different back covers, for example. For this option to work, it is necessary to be authenticated on https://www.makeplayingcards.com to be able to save each deck as Saved Project. This is why the "-a" option will ask for credentials in order to automatically login and save the projects. Once the process is completed, the saved projects can be added in the cart and the order can be completed. You can specify the credentials on the command line with the option "-u" and "-p". If the credentials are not provided, a prompt will request the user to provide them.

## Developer Guide

### Running the Source Code

From the base repo directory:

- `cd autofill`,
- Activate virtual environment or create one with `venv`,
- Install requirements - `pip install -r requirements.txt`,
- Run the tool - `python autofill.py`.

### Packaging with PyInstaller

From the base repo directory:

- `cd autofill`,
- Activate virtual environment or create one with `venv`,
- Install requirements - `pip install -r requirements.txt`,
- Build with PyInstaller - `pyinstaller autofill.spec`,
- The resultant executable will be in `/autofill/dist`.

### Running the Test Suite

Two tests in `tests/test_desktop_client.py` (at the bottom of the file) are marked as skip as they don't work consistently in GitHub Actions. I suggest commenting out the `pytest.mark.skip()` lines when running tests on your machine to run these. Note that they can take a couple of minutes to run as they put through small orders with MPC.
From the base repo directory:

- `cd autofill`,
- Activate virtual environment or create one with `venv`,
- Install requirements - `pip install -r requirements.txt`,
- `cd tests`,
- Run tests - `coverage run -m pytest test_desktop_client.py`,
- Report on code coverage: `coverage report`.

### XML Specification

The tool expects XML files to follow a strict schema as described below.

#### Example

```xml
<order>
    <details>
        <quantity>6</quantity>
        <bracket>18</bracket>
        <stock>(S30) Standard Smooth</stock>
        <foil>false</foil>
    </details>
    <fronts>
        <card>
            <id>1wlrM7pNHQ5NqS9GY5LWH7Hd04TtNgHI4</id>
            <slots>0,1,2,3</slots>
            <name>Rite of Flame.png</name>
            <query>rite of flame</query>
        </card>
           <card>
            <id>1Sy9Me6fD3Kt6eWpN_RX3tGo2DqgUHFwa</id>
            <slots>4,5</slots>
            <name>0. Huntmaster of the Fells.png</name>
            <query>huntmaster of the fells</query>
        </card>
    </fronts>
    <backs>
        <card>
            <id>1M7LJMlEmYumq8QtiYt1HNfJt1Zmi1Y9j</id>
            <slots>4,5</slots>
            <name>0. Ravager of the Fells.png</name>
            <query>ravager of fells</query>
        </card>
    </backs>
    <cardback>C:\Users\chilli-axe\Desktop\cardback.png</cardback>
</order>
```

#### Order Details

- Defined in the `details` tag as:
  - `quantity` - total number of cards in the order. Must be less than or equal to `bracket`.
  - `bracket` - the MPC bracket the order falls into - e.g. ordering 6 cards falls into the bracket of "up to 18 cards". Valid options at time of writing are `18`, `36`, `55`, `72`, `90`, `108`, `126`, `144`, `162`, `180`, `198`, `216`, `234`, `396`, `504`, and `612`.
  - `stock` - the selected cardstock. Valid options are `(S30) Standard Smooth`, `(S33) Superior Smooth`, `(M31) Linen`, and `(P10) Plastic`.
  - `foil` - whether the card fronts should be holographic. Valid options are `true` or `false`.

#### Cards

- Card fronts are defined in the `fronts` tag, and card backs are optionally defined in the `backs` tag (as in, your XML will still be valid if it does not contain the `backs` tag, and only defines `fronts`).
- `fronts` and `backs` should each contain a number of `card` elements.
- Each `card` element is defined as:
  - `id` - can contain a filepath on the computer running the tool or a Google Drive file ID.
  - `slots` - A comma-separated list of the slots within the card's face that this image should be filled into.
  - `name` - The name of the file. If a file with this name exists in the `cards` directory, the tool will use this file rather than downloading the file from Google Drive. This field is **optional** for the desktop client.
  - `query` - The query which returned this image in the web component. This enables re-uploading an existing XML to continue editing, and is **optional** for the desktop client.

#### Cardback

- The `cardback` tag contains a reference to a single image which is allocated to the backs of any cards which don't have back images defined in `backs`.
- Functions identically to the `id` tag in `cards` - if the value is a filepath, the tool will use that file; otherwise, it will treat the value as a Google Drive file ID and attempt to download it from Google Drive.
